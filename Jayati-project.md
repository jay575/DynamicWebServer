### Micro-blogging app

#### Description
1. Microblogging system where users will break down the big problem they are trying to solve into smaller problems and log their processes by stating the problems they had solved, their solution, resources they have used, pointers (page numbers, video time stamp) to the resources and their notes.
2. A visualization of their resource use. It will be like we are all internet cartographers noting down the path of one "useful" resource to another. A visually rich relevant browser history.
3. An aggregate of all visualizations. This will emphasis trending topics. Just the way google maps offers us more and more details in a map as we zoom in, this resource-map will get more detailed as we zoom in.
